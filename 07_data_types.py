'''
Data types tell the computer what kind of data you're working with.

Just like how we have different containers for water, sugar, or eggs â€” in programming, different data types hold different kinds of information.
There are differnt types of data types in Python.
We can get the data types of any objects by using the 'type()' function.
'''
name="Python"
major=3
minor_patch=13.5
comp=1+9j
a=True
print(type(name),type(major),type(minor_patch),type(comp),type(a))

'''
There exist other data types also but those are the most common data types that are used in Python.
